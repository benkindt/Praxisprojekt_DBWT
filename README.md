# Student Committee Management

After a successful login, the interface allows to manage students and assign them to different committees, student associations and legislative periods.

The implementation was part of my student project at TU Chemnitz in 2016 (databases & web techniques).

## Technical details

This project uses mainly HTML, jQuery, Bootstrap and PHP.

The data is queried from a PostgreSQL database. Passwords are stored there as hash values.

In order to run the application a webserver with PHP and the PostgreSQL modules is needed.

After that simply click on the index-page located at /src/index.html.
